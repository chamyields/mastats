## Questions
Consider the paper of David Spiegelhalter (available on Ufora). In this paper
the author examines the age-specific risk of dying (with or from) Covid-19 in
the UK. Table 2 in the paper, gives for several age categories the numbers
of reported Covid-19 deaths, numbers of non-covid related deaths, population
sizes, among other numbers.


## 1. Question

Assign to each age interval a numerical value given by the midpoint (e.g. for 0-4, the midpoint is 
(0+4)/2 =2) and let $p_i$ denote the corresponding
population size in the UK.
Assume that the number of non-covid deaths $(Y^N )$ within an age class
with midpoint $a_i$ $(i = 1,\ldots , 11)$ can be described by a Poisson distribution with mean given by

$$
\text{E}(Y^N|\text{age}=a_i) = p_i\exp(\beta_0^N+\beta_1^Na_i)
$$

(the superscript refers to non-covid).
Also for the covid-related deaths $(Y^C)$ we assume a Poisson distribution
with

$$
\text{E}(Y^C|\text{age}=a_i) = p_i\exp(\beta_0^C+\gamma\beta_1^Na_i)
$$

*How do you interpret the $\gamma$ parameter?*

### Solution

Besides the first and the last age intervals, the difference between the mid point from one age group to the other is 10 years. 

* Lets take a unit increase  in age as 10 years.  Then 
$$
\beta_1^N = \log \text{E}(Y^N|\text{age} = a_i+1) - \log \text{E}(Y^N|\text{age} = a_i)
$$
and 
 $$
\gamma\beta_1^N = \log \text{E}(Y^C|\text{age} = a_i+1) - \log \text{E}(Y^C|\text{age} = a_i)
$$
* $\beta_1^N$ is the expected change in the number of non-covid-19 deaths per unit increase in age in the logarithmic scale
* $\gamma \beta_1^N$ is the expected change in the number of covid-19 deaths per unit increase in age in the logarithmic scale
    
* $\gamma = \gamma\beta_1^N/\beta_1^N$ is ratio of the expected change in the number of covid-19 deaths on the expected change in the number of non-covid 19 deaths for a unit increase in age in the logarithmic scale
* $\gamma>0$ implies for a unit increase in age the expected change in the number of  covid-19 deaths is greater than that of non-covid 19 deaths.  
* $\gamma<0$ implies for a unit increase in age, the expected change in the number of  covid-19 deaths is less than that of non-covid 19 deaths. 
* $\gamma = 0$ implies for a unit increase in age, the expected change in the number of  covid-19 deaths is equal to  that of non-covid 19 deaths.  Hence dying from covid 19 compared to dying from a non-covid 19 cause is independent of age.


## 2. Question

Given the models from the previous question, and assuming that all num-
bers of deaths (both covid and non-covid) are independently distributed.  Construct the log-likelihood function and make a graph of the log-likelihood as a function of the $\gamma$ parameter. You may use the following estimates for the other parameters:

$$
\beta_0^N = −12.06 ~~ \beta_0^C = −14.15 ~~ \beta_0^N = 0.09836
$$
